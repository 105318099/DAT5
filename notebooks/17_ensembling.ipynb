For **classification** problems, the combination is often done by majority vote. For **regression** problems, the combination is often done by taking an average of the predictions.\n",

      "## Wrapping up ensembling\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensembling is incredibly popular, when the **primary goal is predictive accuracy**. For example, the team that eventually won the $1 million [Netflix Prize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) used an [ensemble of 107 models](http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/papers/chance.pdf) early on in the competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a recent paper in the Journal of Machine Learning Research titled \"[Do We Need Hundreds of Classifiers to Solve Real World Classification Problems?](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume15/delgado14a/delgado14a.pdf)\" (**Spoiler alert:** Random Forests did very well.) In the [comments about the paper](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8719723) on Hacker News, Ben Hamner (Kaggle's chief scientist) said the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "> This is consistent with our experience running hundreds of Kaggle competitions: for most classification problems, some variation on ensembled decision trees (random forests, gradient boosted machines, etc.) performs the best. This is typically in conjunction with clever data processing, feature selection, and internal validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "> One key exception is where the data is richly and hierarchically structured. Text, speech, and visual data falls under this category. In many cases here, variations of neural networks (deep neural nets/CNN's/RNN's/etc.) provide very dramatic improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as you can imagine, ensembling may not often be practical in a real-time environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**You can also build your own ensembles:** just build a variety of models and average them together! Here are some strategies for building independent models:\n",
      "\n",
      "- using different models\n",
      "- choosing different combinations of features\n",
      "- changing the tuning parameters\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that there is an entire class of well-known ensembling methods that we did not discuss, namely **boosting**. Instead of building independent models and averaging the predictions, the models are built sequentially on repeatedly modified versions of the data. More information is available in the scikit-learn documentation on Ensemble Methods, namely the sections on [AdaBoost](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#adaboost) and [Gradient Tree Boosting](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-tree-boosting)."
