### Logistics
* Office hours will take place every Saturday and Sunday.
* Homework will be assigned every Wednesday and due on Monday, and you'll receive feedback by Wednesday.
* The course project is split into two parts. You'll present the first part in the middle of the course, and the second part at the end of the course.
* Our primary tool for out-of-class communication will be a private chat room through [Slack](https://slack.com/).


### Before the Course Begins
* Install the [Anaconda distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads) of Python 2.7x.
* Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
* Once you receive an email invitation from Slack, join our "DAT5 team" and add your photo.
* Choose a [Python workshop](https://generalassemb.ly/education?format=classes-workshops) to attend, depending upon your current skill level:
    * Beginner: [Saturday 3/7 10am-2pm](https://generalassemb.ly/education/introduction-to-python-programming/washington-dc/11137) or [Thursday 3/12 6:30pm-9pm](https://generalassemb.ly/education/introduction-to-python-programming/washington-dc/11136)
    * Intermediate: [Saturday 3/14 10am-2pm](https://generalassemb.ly/education/python-for-data-science-intermediate/washington-dc/11167)
* Practice your Python using the resources below.


### Python Resources
* [Codecademy's Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): Good beginner material, including tons of in-browser exercises.
* [DataQuest](https://dataquest.io/missions): Similar interface to Codecademy, but focused on teaching Python in the context of data science.
* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/): Slightly more advanced, including hours of useful lecture videos and downloadable exercises (with solutions).
* [A Crash Course in Python for Scientists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182): Read through the Overview section for a quick introduction to Python.
* [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php): A very beginner-oriented book, with associated [slides](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7X1ycQalUnyal9yeUx3VW81VDg&usp=sharing) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj4JXIwMwN1_ss1Tk8wZShEJ).
* Code from our [beginner](code/00_python_beginner_workshop.py) and [intermediate](code/00_python_intermediate_workshop.py) workshops: Useful for review and reference.
