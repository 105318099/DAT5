## Class 5 Homework: Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Read this excellent article, [Understanding the Bias-Variance Tradeoff](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html), and be prepared to **discuss it in class** on Monday.

**Note:** You can ignore sections 4.2 and 4.3.

Here are some questions to think about while you read:
* In the Party Registration example, what are the features? What is the response? Is this a regression or classification problem?
* In the interactive visualization, try using different values for K across different sets of training data. What value of K do you think is "best"? How do you define "best"?
* In the visualization, what do the lighter colors versus the darker colors mean? How is the darkness calculated?
* How does the choice of K affect model bias? How about variance?
* As you experiment with K and generate new training data, how can you "see" high versus low variance? How can you "see" high versus low bias?
* Why should we care about variance at all? Shouldn't we just minimize bias and ignore variance?
* Does a high value for K cause over-fitting or under-fitting?
